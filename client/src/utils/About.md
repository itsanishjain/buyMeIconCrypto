## Inspiration

We all know about BuymeCoffee and Patreon which supports creators, developers all over the world. but we all come from different countries, backgrounds it's relatively hard to support your favorite creators when they are from extreme countries, well these companies try their best to connect audiences and their favorite creators.

But there is a problem they are Centralised and that's why these giants are charging a lot.
for example:
`Patreon takes 8%` of total revenue each month which is quite high 
and `BuymeCoffee takes a 5% transaction fee` which is too much for smaller creators.

and still, barriers to different countries because of governments policies makes these platform not ideal for the current global world where people are sharing and learning form with/different people 

and that makes me decide to build a buy me coffee for cryptos 
and I guess 
> ICON blockchain is one of the best options for this because of its hyper-connectivity 

## What it does

it is a really simple tool that allows anyone to send their ICX in a very simple and intuitive way to their favorite content creators. Content creators need to share their ICON address to connect with their audience. it's that simple. there are some more exciting futures plans which I share below.

## How we built it

I use the ICON blockchain via `Icon-JS-SDK` for things related to 
- connecting to the ICONex/HANA wallets.
- For sending transactions from the audience to their favorite content creators. 
- the app is itself built using React and I try to make UI as intuitive as possible so anyone can easily interact with it.

## Challenges we ran into

Well I am just getting started with Web3 space and there is a lot of content related to Ethereum but with Icon it's a little bit difficult to find out, so it took me so long to solve any bugs.

for example with 
- `JS-SDK` there is no clear and intuitive way to get
started with `HTTP provider`, it works when we import Icon SDK as default but it took me hours and in the end, I have to raise the Github issue to get it solved. but their GitHub community is great.

- Connecting to wallets is again a challenge for me 

community is out there but still so new hence the necessity for more docs is required. but somehow with the support of GitHub and Telegram group I finally build something which I am proud of 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

after a lot of struggles, I am finally able to build an app that sends ICX to anyone in a very intuitive and secure way it.

Learning about an entirely new blockchain into the space when everyone talks about Ethereum, Solana. 

just understanding why we need, a `hyper-connected blockchain`  in the current world where there are lots of different kinds of blockchains that provide their own USPs.

## What we learned

An entirely new blockchain, before this hackathon I think they're only 2 main blockchain networks `Bitcoin and Ethereum` but `ICON` seems really powerful to me. I mean it tries to connect different blockchains so many amazing things are possible with this.

I am very new to this WEB3 space so learning about blockchains is quite big for me but Now I know I don't have to depend on others to learn anything new. There are communities behind every great project and they are very helpful. with ICON, I think I want to build this platform 

Learn a lot about React which is a front-end framework I do know about React but never used it extensively so using it for this big hackathon is quite scary but at the same time, I learn a lot.

## What's next for BuyMeIconCrypto

As of now, there is nothing for content creators to keep track of there their audience so building an admin panel for them is my number 1 priority

for the audience, there is no easy way to find their favorite content creators.

integrations seem really powerful features for this app it works like anyone with just 1 click added this to their social media as we do with Patreon. hence encourages mass adoptions.

and all these things are possible with ICON so if I won this hackathon 100% I am working on this.
